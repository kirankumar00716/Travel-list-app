# Travel List

Welcome to the Travel List project! This application is built using React.js and demonstrates core fundamental concepts such as state management, controlled elements, state uplifting, derived state, and parent-child relationships. The project provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing a travel packing list, with features that enhance usability and user experience.

## Features

- **Add Items**: Easily add new items to your travel list.
- **Delete Items**: Remove items from your list with a simple click.
- **Strike Packed Items**: Mark items as packed by checking the associated checkbox, visually striking them out.
- **Sorting**: Sort your list based on different criteria, such as the order of input, description, or packed status.
- **Clear All**: A convenient button to clear all items from the list.
- **Stats**: View statistics including the total number of items, the number of packed items, and the percentage of items left to pack.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **State Management**: Utilizing React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage and track the state of the application.
- **Controlled Elements**: Implementing controlled components for form inputs.
- **Uplifting State**: Sharing state between components by lifting it up to the nearest common ancestor.
- **Derived State**: Calculating derived data from the existing state, such as the stats feature.
